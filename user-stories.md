## Marketing Team Story
As a marketing researcher, I want to provide a catchy and attractive page using all 20 images, yet none at the same time side by side to convert my subjects into customers with the sick stylez.

## Dev Story
As a developer I want to create content so that the user has the smoothest experience possible and understands how the pages works and there is no confusion from start to finish.

## Open Testing Story
As a User I want to know exactly what it is I am looking at without putting too much mental effort in the process so that I can appreciate the art, the product, without being distracted by shit process.
